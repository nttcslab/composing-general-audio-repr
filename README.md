# Composing General Audio Representation by Fusing Multilayer Features of a Pre-trained Model

This repository *will* offer implementation of our paper "Composing General Audio Representation by Fusing Multilayer Features of a Pre-trained Model".

## To reviewers

After the notification, we will prepare the following contents:

- Model implementations.
- Demo code (or tutorial).
- Evaluation command lines for reproduction.

Our code will be using [EVAR](https://github.com/nttcslab/eval-audio-repr), an evaluation package of audio representation.
